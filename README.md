# Username Registry Smart Contract

## Description

The **Username Registry Smart Contract** is a decentralized application built on the Aptos blockchain that enables users to register and manage unique usernames in a trustless environment. This smart contract provides a transparent and immutable system for username ownership, eliminating the need for centralized authorities to manage digital identities.

The contract features a dual-mapping system that maintains both username-to-address and address-to-username relationships, ensuring efficient lookups and preventing duplicate registrations. Users can register unique usernames that are permanently associated with their blockchain addresses, creating a foundation for decentralized identity management.

Key features include:
- **Unique Username Registration**: Ensures no duplicate usernames can be registered
- **Bidirectional Mapping**: Efficient lookup system for both usernames and addresses
- **Ownership Verification**: Cryptographic proof of username ownership
- **Immutable Records**: Tamper-proof registration stored on blockchain
- **Gas Efficient**: Optimized for minimal transaction costs

## Vision

Our vision is to create a **decentralized identity infrastructure** that empowers users to own and control their digital identities without relying on centralized platforms. We aim to build the foundation for a new internet where usernames are truly owned by individuals, not corporations.

The Username Registry represents the first step toward:

- **True Digital Ownership**: Users have complete control over their digital identities
- **Interoperability**: Usernames that work across multiple dApps and platforms
- **Censorship Resistance**: No single entity can revoke or modify username ownership
- **Privacy and Security**: User data remains under individual control
- **Democratic Governance**: Community-driven development and feature additions

We envision a future where blockchain-based usernames become the standard for digital identity, enabling seamless interaction across decentralized applications while maintaining user sovereignty and privacy.
